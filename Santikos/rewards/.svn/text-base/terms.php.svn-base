              <p>1) The Santikos Reel Deal Rewards Program is open to anyone except Santikos Theatres associates, their immediate family members, and children under 13 unless they have parental or legal guardian consent. Santikos Theatres reserves the right to exclude others in its sole discretion.</p>
              <p>2) Membership is free and may be acquired by registering online at Santikos.com. You will be able to print a temporary card when you have completed your on-line registration. Your permanent card will arrive at the address provided in 3-4 weeks.</p>
              <p>3) Reel Deal Rewards cards must be presented at the time of transaction to receive reward points. Points are only available post-transaction if the reward system malfunctions; i.e. the card swipe malfunctions or the computer is inaccessible. Points are not available post transaction if the rewards card is not presented prior to a transaction's completion.</p>
              <p>4) Reel Deal Rewards members are awarded 1 point for every dollar spent. Members are limited to a maximum of 15 points per transaction and 30 points per day. Members earn points only for the monetary amount tendered, points are not earned on discounts or when redeeming free admission tickets or Super Savers. Points are earned when Santikos gift cards or gift certificates are redeemed, not when they are purchased.</p>
              <p>5) Reel Deal Rewards members earn free rewards after each 45-point accumulation. All rewards are valid only through the expiration date printed on the Reel Deal Rewards point receipt received at the time of the ticket transaction. All rewards have no case value. The Reel Deal Rewards structure repeats at each 360-point accumulation. Refer to the rewards schedule online or in the information provided at any Santikos Theatre.</p></td>
              <td id="copy" width="50%"><p>6) Each reward is exclusive to the item printed on the reward receipt. Rewards items may be upgraded for a fee. All rewards for free drinks are fountain drinks, unless otherwise specified.</p>
                <p>7) All reward vouchers must be surrendered upon redemption.</p>
              <p>8) Reel Deal Rewards are subject to verification by Santikos management. Offers are void if rewards are illegible, altered or damaged beyond recognition. Santikos Theatres is under no obligation to replace lost or destroyed rewards or discount coupons of any kind under any circumstances. The judgment of Santikos management is final.</p>
              <p>9) Santikos Theatres protects personal information we collect about members by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. Advertisers and other companies do not have access to personal information and we do not share your personal information with advertisers or other companies that want to contact members. Members must designate not to receive information from Santikos Theatres, which may include coupon mailers, e-mail, Santikos News and other correspondence.</p>
              <p>10) Santikos Reel Deal Rewards cards, points and free rewards are nontransferable, except for points transferred from a lost, stolen or damaged card to a new card issued to the same member.</p>
              <p>11) Santikos Reel Deal Rewards points will be forfeited immediately upon inactivity of 24 months. Reel Deal rewards points have no monetary value, are not gift certificates and may only be used for rewards as specified under the Terms and Conditions.</p>
              <p>12) Santikos reserves the right to change or discontinue the Reel Deal Rewards program at any time without liability to any member.</p></td>
